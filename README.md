# Skill Registry (skr)

**skr** is a tool designed to manage [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/what-are-skills)—a lightweight, open format for extending AI agent capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows.

## Goal

The primary goal of **skr** is to enable the pushing, pulling, and maintenance of Agent Skills using OCI (Open Container Initiative) Image registries, similar to the workflow used for container images on platforms like GitHub or Docker Hub.

This allows for a standardized, versioned, and distributed ecosystem for sharing AI capabilities.
